# Collected Dataset
For training, we are going to use the three available datasets listed below. 

1. UJI Pen Characters Data Set (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/UJI+Pen+Characters)
    This data consists of 1364 instances of characters, with 62 labels (26 alphabet 
    characters in both upper and lower case, and 10 digits from 0 to 9). Each instance has series of x, y coordinates, PEN_DOWN, PEN_UP, and label. 

2. Pen Based Recognition of Handwritten Digits Dataset 
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pen-Based+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits)
    This dataset is a collection of 250 samples from 44 writers. The x, y coordinates of the data are used, with raw point data regularly spaced in time. The dataset is regularly spaced in total of 8 frames, each with (x,y) coordinates normalized into 100 x 100 pixels grid. (1.5 MB)

3. Character Trajectories Data Set (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Character+Trajectories)
    This dataset consists of 2858 instances of lowercase alphabet letters (20 letters). Each 
    instance has series of x, y coordinates, and a pen tip force value, which we will ignore for our use. (7.5 MB)
